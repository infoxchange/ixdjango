Dependencies
------------

* Django: Might work on older versions but was developed for 1.3.0.
* pep8 and pylint: Not required for functionality but we like QC before
committing any code changes so these tools need to be available. Note that
if you'd like to contribute, any code you write must give a clean output with
pep8 and score 10/10 with pylint using the configuration file
conf/pylint.conf in the package
